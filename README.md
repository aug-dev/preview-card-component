## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Filters
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned with this project was how to apply **filters** to images in CSS.

Even though I don't have a complete grasp on how the different blend modes work, I found one that does what I need, and this is enough for now.

Here's the code snippet:

```css
.mobile-image, .desktop-image {
    fiLter: contrast(60%) brightness(115%);
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Continued development

I need some kind of **system** in which I can organize the different font sizes I need for a project, instead of having seemingly random numbers all accros the place.
